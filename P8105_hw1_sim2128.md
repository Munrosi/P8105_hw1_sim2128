#You can convert the logical and factor vectors to numeric, but you are unable to covert the character vector to numeric. This would explain why the mean of the character variable cannot be taken, the characters do not correspond to any numeric values.

**Problem 2**

``` r
set.seed(500)
part2_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  logicv = x + y > 1,
  numberv = as.numeric(logicv),
  factorv = as.factor(numberv)
)
```

The dataset `part2_df1` has 500 rows and 5 columns. The mean of x is
-0.0455615, the median is -0.0385267, and the standard deviation is
1.0165813. The proportion of `logicv` for which x + y \> 1 is 0.22

``` r
#Scatter plot with colors corresponding to the logical vector
ggplot(part2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color=logicv)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
#The distribution appeared the same for all three plots. The colors appeared the same only for the plots corresponding to the logical and factor vector. For the plot with colors corresponding to the numeric vector, there was a scale of color rather than 2 single options of red or blue.
